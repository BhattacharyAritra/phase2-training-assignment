1. Create a java program to reads a text file and print the count of each word in console output, use a MAP datatype to store the words and its count later print the map. Also write corresponding Junit Test case and build it using maven and host the codebase in github.
2. Create a java program to take a range of number array as input and print the prime numbers till the input number using multithreading functionality. For e.g: If I give 100, Prime numbers till 100 should be printing in console. Also write corresponding Junit Test case and build it using maven and host the codebase in github.
3. Create a java program to reads list of numbers from a file (csv or txt file that contains only number string). Sort the numbers in ascending order and print only the distinct number using Java Streams functionality and also write corresponding Junit Test case and build it using maven and host the codebase in github.
4. Bundle previously assigned programs to a Jar/War file and build it using maven and deploy it over a webserver and start a service to serve the reques
